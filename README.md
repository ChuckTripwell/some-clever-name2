# what?
DIY archlinux-bootc image with gaming-oriented optimizations.

# why?
We wanted the stability of Bazzite but also the speed of Cachyos...and now we have it!

# how?
this is similar to building your own ublue-os image. please go to their website first!

in short:
1. fork this repo, add your own packages ( a desktop, some drivers, your logo, services etc. )
2. use cosign to generate a key-pair to use in secrets...(more information here: https://ublue.it/ )
3. install bazzite (or any other bootc-based os) and rebase:
```
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/<your name>/<image-name>:latest
```
^^^::replace with your image url, generated by this repo::^^^
4. reboot and enjoy.

further instructions are inside the Containerfile.

# is it safe?
it depends:

-if you used bootc-based images before then you should be fine.
     note: this is a one-way trip!!! you will not be able to go back to ublue-os/fedora/bazzite after rebasing!!!!

# can I just pull this image into my Containerfile instead of forking it?
yes, but note that you'll be stuck with the default linux-cachyos kernel.

#TODO:
- proper documentation
- create a way of using the generated image with different kernels instead of forking the repo
- create a dedicated iso
- add variables so that users can add stuff without messing with the code too much
- add quality of life packages
- add configs for secureboot
- systemctl services to automate stuff like successful boot and such....
