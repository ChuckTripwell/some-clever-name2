### FrankengoldOS ###

# what?
DIY archlinux-bootc image with gaming-oriented optimizations.

# why?
We wanted the stability of Bazzite but also the speed of Cachyos...and now we have it!

# how?
this is similar to building your own ublue-os image. please go to their website first!

in short:
1. fork this repo, add your own packages ( a desktop, some drivers, your logo, services etc. )
2. install bazzite (or any other bootc-based os) and rebase:
```
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/<your name>/<image-name>:latest
```
^^^::replace with your image url, generated by this repo::^^^
3. reboot and enjoy.

further instructions are inside the Containerfile.

# is it safe?
it depends:

-if you used bootc-based images before then you should be fine.
note: this is a one-way trip!!! you will not be able to go back to ublue-os/fedora/bazzite after rebasing!!!!

-it doesn't use any packages from the aur, if that's what your'e worried about.
(don't worry, you can still use the aur in distrobox)
